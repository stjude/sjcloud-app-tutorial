# BWA-MEM alignment (DNAnexus Platform App)

Align sequencing reads to a genome using BWA-MEM

This is the source code for an app that runs on the DNAnexus Platform.
For more information about how to run or modify it, see
https://wiki.dnanexus.com/.

<!-- Insert a description of your app here -->
This is an example application aligning FastQ files to a reference 
genome using BWA (http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/). It provides a 
set of predefined genome options that the user can select. The BWA 
index files are then pulled from a common reference data repository. 
This is the preferred way to handle common reference data to avoid 
duplication, provide consistency, and avoid including large reference 
data in the resources for a given app.
