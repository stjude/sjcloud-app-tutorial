<!-- Insert a description of your app here -->
This is an example application that uses Cutadapt (https://cutadapt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) 
to trim adapter sequence from FastQ files. This application demonstrates 
using the resources directory to provide files to an application. In this 
case we provide a set of forward and reverse adapter sequences that we 
then use as inputs to cutadapt to remove from input seqeunces.
