<!-- Insert a description of your app here -->
This is an example application that uses samtools (http://www.htslib.org/) 
and Picard Tools (https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/) to convert 
a BAM file back to FastQ files. It provides some basic quality control 
of the input BAM. It then splits the BAM by read group. The per-read 
group BAMs are then converted to paired FastQ files. This app provides 
an example of returning an array of files.
